/**
 * Refuses to let a credential-bearing file into git.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * A sibling repo committed `.env` files years ago. The history was rewritten
 * and force-pushed, which removed them from every clone, from blame and from
 * code search — and did NOT remove them from GitHub, because `refs/pull/*` is
 * server-side and cannot be force-pushed or deleted. A fresh anonymous clone
 * still reached them. Twenty-three variables were exposed and nobody knew,
 * because nothing ever asked the question.
 *
 * Deleting a secret from a repository is expensive and, on a public repo,
 * never fully succeeds. Not adding one is free. So this runs in CI.
 *
 * It makes two assertions, and the second is the one that matters
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------
 *  1. No tracked file is credential-bearing by name.  Catches today.
 *  2. The repo's ignore rules actually stop such a file from being added.
 *     Catches tomorrow.
 *
 * (2) is deliberately not "grep .gitignore for `.env`". A pattern list read
 * off a file is a claim about behaviour; `git check-ignore` is the behaviour.
 * They come apart constantly — a nested .gitignore that re-includes, a rule
 * that only matches at the root, an `.env` rule that does not cover
 * `.env.production`. So this asks git, per probe path, per package directory.
 *
 * A negative control runs too: `.env.example` must NOT be ignored. A repo that
 * ignores it has quietly lost the one env file it is supposed to commit, and a
 * blanket `.env*` with no re-include looks correct right up until someone
 * wonders where the example went.
