    <p>Embarking on a journey to solve 700+ Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems was one of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences in my software engineering career. In this blog post, I'll share my comprehensive journey, strategies, and lessons learned along the way.</p>

    <h2>Why I Started This Journey</h2>
    <p>As a software engineer, I realized that strong problem-solving skills are crucial for both professional growth and technical interviews. While building real-world applications is important, having a solid foundation in DSA opens doors to more opportunities and helps write more efficient code.</p>

    <h2>My Structured Approach</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Topic-wise Learning:</strong> Started with basic arrays and strings, gradually moving to more complex topics like trees, graphs, and dynamic programming.</li>
      <li><strong>Daily Commitment:</strong> Set a goal to solve at least 2-3 problems every day, regardless of their difficulty level.</li>
      <li><strong>Platform Selection:</strong> Used LeetCode, GeeksForGeeks, and CodeForces for diverse problem sets and different perspectives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Breaking Down the Journey</h2>
    <p>Here's how I distributed my practice across different topics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Arrays & Strings (150+ problems)</li>
      <li>Linked Lists & Stacks (100+ problems)</li>
      <li>Trees & Binary Search (120+ problems)</li>
      <li>Graphs & Advanced Data Structures (130+ problems)</li>
      <li>Dynamic Programming (150+ problems)</li>
      <li>Mixed & Contest Problems (50+ problems)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Strategies That Worked</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> Instead of memorizing solutions, focused on identifying common patterns across similar problems.</li>
      <li><strong>Time Management:</strong> Allocated specific time slots for different difficulty levels - 20 minutes for easy, 40 for medium, and 1 hour for hard problems.</li>
      <li><strong>Review & Revision:</strong> Maintained a notebook of tricky problems and reviewed them weekly.</li>
      <li><strong>Implementation Focus:</strong> Always implemented solutions from scratch, even if I knew the approach.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
    <p>The journey wasn't without its challenges:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Initial struggle with Dynamic Programming concepts</li>
      <li>Time management between work and consistent practice</li>
      <li>Dealing with problem-solving plateaus</li>
      <li>Maintaining motivation during difficult periods</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Measuring Progress</h2>
    <p>I tracked my progress through various metrics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Solving time for different problem categories</li>
      <li>Success rate in weekly contests</li>
      <li>Number of problems solved without hints</li>
      <li>Implementation time for known approaches</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Impact on Professional Growth</h2>
    <p>This journey significantly impacted my professional life:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improved code optimization skills in real projects</li>
      <li>Better understanding of space-time complexity trade-offs</li>
      <li>Enhanced problem-solving approach in system design</li>
      <li>Increased confidence in technical discussions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advice for Others</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Start Small:</strong> Begin with easy problems to build confidence</li>
      <li><strong>Be Consistent:</strong> Regular practice is more important than long sporadic sessions</li>
      <li><strong>Understand Deeply:</strong> Don't just solve, understand why certain approaches work better</li>
      <li><strong>Learn from Others:</strong> Study different approaches to the same problem</li>
      <li><strong>Take Breaks:</strong> Avoid burnout by maintaining a sustainable pace</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tools and Resources</h2>
    <p>Here are some resources that helped me in my journey:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>LeetCode Premium for company-specific questions</li>
      <li>AlgoExpert for structured learning</li>
      <li>GeeksForGeeks for detailed explanations</li>
      <li>GitHub repositories for tracking progress</li>
      <li>Discord communities for peer learning</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Solving 700+ DSA problems was not just about preparing for interviews or improving technical skills. It was a journey of personal growth, persistence, and continuous learning. Whether you're just starting or already on this path, remember that consistency and the right approach are key to success.</p>

    <p>Remember, the goal isn't just to solve problems but to become a better problem solver. Each problem you solve adds to your toolkit and makes you a more competent engineer.</p>
