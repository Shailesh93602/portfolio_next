## 👤 Your Tasks (manual — see MANUAL.md for exact steps)

### Priority 1 — Quick Wins (< 2 hours total)

- [ ] 👤 **Provide education details** for About page:
  - College/University name
  - Degree (e.g., B.Tech Computer Science)
  - Graduation year
  - CGPA (optional but recommended if ≥ 8.0)
  - Reply here or in MANUAL.md section 1

- [ ] 👤 **Set up Google Analytics** (30 min):
  - Create GA4 property → get Measurement ID (G-XXXXXXXX)
  - Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXX` to Vercel env vars
  - Redeploy

- [ ] 👤 **Remove/replace `public/google5c16a36058a0e9e7.html`** — this Google Search Console verification file is a security exposure. Either keep it (if you need GSC) or delete it.

### Priority 2 — Portfolio Quality (2-5 hours)

- [ ] 👤 **Run Lighthouse on your live portfolio** and screenshot results:
  - URL: https://shaileshchaudhari.vercel.app
  - Save screenshot to `public/Images/lighthouse-score.png`

- [ ] 👤 **Write one deep technical blog post** — pick one:
  - Option A: "Building a Real-Time Battle Zone: Redis + Socket.io Inside EduScale"
  - Option B: "My First PR to Next.js — What I Learned Trying to Contribute to Open Source"
  - Add it to `lib/blog-data.ts` and `data/blog-manifest.json`

- [ ] 👤 **Verify all project live links still work**:
  - https://eduscale.vercel.app ← check
  - https://daily-dev-track.vercel.app ← check
  - https://khatago.vercel.app ← check

### Priority 3 — Nice to Have

- [ ] 👤 Add your GitHub activity to display open source contribution attempt in About page bio
- [ ] 👤 Consider adding a `projects/[slug]` detail page for EduScale and Vibe Testing with architecture diagrams
